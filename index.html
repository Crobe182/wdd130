    <p>I am a computer science major and member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints!</p>
    <p>I like to do a lot of different things from playing video games and watching Star Wars to camping, lifting weights, and shooting guns. I hope to become a video game developer, and am looking to get into 3D printing and learning how to use Blender for 3D modeling.</p>
